Instructions:
Aim to complete as much as you can in 1 hour.
Use any online resources you need to solve the problems.
Feel free to use any integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor of your choice.

Part 1: Django REST Framework (20 minutes)
Create a Django model for a simple todo list item with the specified fields.
Implement a Django REST Framework serializer for the todo list item model.
Create a Django REST Framework API view to handle CRUD operations for the todo list item model.

Bonus (Optional):
Implement a GraphQL API using Graphene Django for the todo list item model.

Part 2: React (30 minutes)
Set up a new React project using Create React App.
Create a React component to display a list of todo list items fetched from the Django REST Framework API.
Add functionality to allow updating the completion status of a todo list item directly from the React component.

Bonus (Optional):
Integrate Apollo Client in your React project to fetch and manage data from the GraphQL API implemented in Django.

Additional Notes:
Remember to handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback where applicable.
Focus on functionality rather than complex styling.
Use appropriate naming conventions and follow best practices in both Django and React development.
